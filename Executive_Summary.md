## Executive Summary: Subreddit Classification and Intel GPU Model Detection
___

As part of our commission with Intel, we were tasked with creating a classification model that can accurately identify the subreddit of a given Reddit, and create an MVP in order to identify the Intel GPU model numbers within an individual post. The aim of this project is to help Intel better understand the market reach of their GPU models, and to inform their marketing and development efforts going forward.

To achieve these goals, we pulled data from the Pushshift API, a third-party API that allows for easy access to Reddit data. We cleaned and preprocessed the data, removing any irrelevant or redundant information, and used a combination of natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to develop a classification model that can accurately identify the subreddit of a given post.

Additionally, we developed an MVP as a regex string to detect Intel GPU model numbers within individual posts. This proof of concept/MVP regex technique will pave the way forward on creating a model to detect the Intel GPU model numbers in combination with the model to delineate subreddit.

Overall, our model and MVP have the potential to provide valuable insights into the market reach of Intel's GPU models. By accurately identifying the subreddits where discussions about Intel GPUs are taking place, we can gain a better understanding of the audience and demographics that are most interested in Intel's products. Furthermore, by detecting mentions of specific Intel GPU models, we can gain insights into which models are most popular or influential within these communities.

We believe that our model can be further refined and optimized with additional data and tuning, and we recommend ongoing monitoring and evaluation of these models to ensure that they remain accurate and relevant over time.

In conclusion, our classification model has the potential to provide valuable insights into the market reach of Intel's GPU models, and we believe that they can inform Intel's marketing and development efforts going forward.
